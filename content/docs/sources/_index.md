## What is a source?

A source is where the user event data originates from. Examples of common sources include websites, mobile apps, social media platforms, customer relationship management (CRM) systems, and point-of-sale (POS) systems. Each source generates data that can provide valuable insights into user behavior, preferences, and interactions.

You can create multiple sources to stream user event data into the system. The system will stitch the events under the same user when the user ID is provided in the event data.

If you cannot see the source you are looking for in our source options, use the HTTPS API source to collect data by sending JSON data.
